# Deployment variables

Every value the CI/CD pipeline needs, and where it has to live once the two repositories
become one.

Today each repository has its own set of GitHub secrets, so both workflows can read
`secrets.HOST_ENV` and `secrets.WORK_DIR` and get different values. In a monorepo there is one
secret store for both apps: **anything that differs between the frontend and the backend must
be split by name**, or the second workflow silently deploys with the first one's values.

---

## GitHub secrets

Repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → *Repository secrets*.

### Shared — one value for the whole repository

| Secret | Used by | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SSH_HOST` | both workflows | Production host the image is copied to and deployed on |
| `SSH_USER` | both workflows | SSH user on the production host. It must reach the root Docker daemon — `root` itself, or a user in the `docker` group |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | both workflows | Private key for that user, no passphrase |

If the API and the site ever move to different hosts, these split the same way as everything
below (`SSH_HOST_WEB` / `SSH_HOST_API`).

### Per app — must be split

| Secret | Replaces | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST_ENV_WEB` | `HOST_ENV` (frontend repo) | Whole `.env` file for `apps/web`, written by the workflow before `docker build` |
| `HOST_ENV_API` | `HOST_ENV` (backend repo) | Whole `.env` file for `apps/api` |
| `HOST_ENV_INFRA` | new | Whole `.env` file for `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` — see below |

There is no path secret any more. The deploy owns the containers outright — `docker run
--restart always` from the workflow — so nothing has to exist on the host beforehand and no
directory is `cd`-ed into. `WORK_DIR` and `DEPLOY_ROOT` can both be deleted.

`HOST_ENV_INFRA` has no equivalent on the old host — it is a new file, written from
`infra/.env.example`, with passwords generated once (`openssl rand -base64 24`). One catch:
`MONGO_ROOT_*` is applied only to an empty `mongo-data` volume. Restoring a dump into a fresh
volume takes the new credentials; copying the old volume across keeps the old ones, and then
these two keys have to repeat what the old host used.

`HOST_ENV_*` is a multi-line secret: the entire file, one `KEY=value` per line. The workflow
writes it to the app's own directory, not to the repository root:

```yaml
- name: Build images
  run: |
    if [ "$DEPLOY_WEB" = "true" ]; then
      echo "${{ secrets.HOST_ENV_WEB }}" > apps/web/.env
      docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile -t mooncellar-frontend:latest .
    fi
```

### Where the production values actually live

**A GitHub secret cannot be read back** — not through the UI, not through the API, not by the
repository owner. The existing `HOST_ENV` of either repository is therefore not a source you
can copy from.

The production environment exists on the host, baked into the running image by the current
`COPY ./.env .env`. Lift it from there:

```bash
docker ps
docker exec <container> cat /app/.env
# or, without touching the running container:
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat mooncellar-frontend:latest /app/.env
```

After the migration those paths become `/app/apps/web/.env` and `/app/apps/api/.env`.

**Do not seed the secrets from a developer's local `.env`.** Ours mixes localhost URLs with
live credentials, and it is missing half the variables the code reads — a build from it would
ship a site calling `localhost:3228` with empty canonical links. Reconcile what you pull off
the host against the tables below, then set the secrets from that file:

```bash
gh secret set HOST_ENV_WEB   < prod-web.env
gh secret set HOST_ENV_API   < prod-api.env
gh secret set HOST_ENV_INFRA < prod-infra.env
```

Managing repository secrets requires the **admin** role; write access is not enough. Check with
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo> --jq .permissions`.

### `HOST_ENV_INFRA` — contents

Written to `infra/.env` before the directory is copied, and read by
`infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` through `${...}` interpolation. Every key is required: compose
refuses to start rather than fall back to `admin`.

| Variable | Secret | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGO_DATA_DIR` | no | Absolute path on the host bind-mounted as MongoDB's `/data/db` — `/home/admin/mongodb` on the old host, which is what the podman `run.sh` mounted. A directory, not a named volume, so the data stays where an operator can see it and `docker compose down -v` cannot take it with the rest. **A typo here does not fail** by default: Docker creates the missing directory and MongoDB initialises an empty database in it, which looks like a successful deploy of a site with no games. All three data mounts therefore set `create_host_path: false`, so compose refuses to start on a path that does not exist |
| `MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME` | **yes** | MongoDB root user, created **only** when `MONGO_DATA_DIR` is empty. A directory carried over from another host already holds its users, and these two keys are then ignored — set them to the old values anyway, or the next person cannot tell which credentials are live. Must match the API's `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` |
| `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` | **yes** | Its password |
| `GRAFANA_DATA_DIR` | no | Host directory bind-mounted as `/var/lib/grafana` — `/home/admin/grafana` on the old host. It holds every dashboard built in the UI; only the JSON under `infra/grafana/provisioning/` comes from the repository |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER` | **yes** | Grafana admin login |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | **yes** | Grafana admin password |
| `PROMETHEUS_DATA_DIR` | no | Host directory bind-mounted as `/prometheus` — `/home/admin/prometheus` on the old host. Seven days of metrics history; losing it is survivable, keeping it is one line |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | **yes** | Bearer token Prometheus sends when scraping the API's `/metrics`. Must be byte-identical to the API's own `METRICS_TOKEN`, or every scrape is a 401 |
| `SEARXNG_SECRET` | **yes** | SearXNG's `server.secret_key` (`openssl rand -hex 32`). `infra/searxng/settings.yml` is committed without it, so the key never lands in git |

`METRICS_TOKEN` is also written to `infra/prometheus/metrics_token`, because a Prometheus
config file cannot read an environment variable — `prometheus.prod.yml` points
`credentials_file` at it. The file is gitignored; it exists only on the runner and the host.

The two `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_*` values in `infra/docker-compose.yml` stay `admin`/`admin`: that
file is the local development stack and is never deployed.

### The host runs root Docker

The deploy job builds both images on the runner, ships them as one gzipped archive and starts
them with `docker run -d --restart always`. Two consequences worth knowing before touching it:

- **The container is the unit of deployment — there is no `run.sh` and no systemd unit on the
  host.** A redeploy is `docker rm -f` followed by `docker run`, and `--restart always` is what
  brings both apps back after a reboot or a crash — including one stopped by hand, because the
  policy is re-applied when the daemon starts. `docker stop` therefore holds only until the next
  reboot; to take an app down for longer, remove the container. This needs `systemctl enable
  docker` on the host: a restart policy is executed by the daemon, so a daemon that does not
  start at boot brings nothing up with it.
- **Everything shares one user-defined network, `mooncellar`, and talks over container DNS.**
  The deploy creates it before anything starts; `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` joins it as an
  external network. The old host published every one of these ports and had the apps reach them
  back through the podman gateway; inside the network they reach `mongodb:27017`, `loki:3100`,
  `alloy:12347`, `searxng:8080` and each other (`mooncellar-backend:3228`) by name, so **no
  infrastructure port is published on a public interface** — a database on a root-Docker box
  would otherwise be on the public internet, because Docker's iptables rules are not filtered by
  a host firewall. Only Grafana (`127.0.0.1:3000`) and MongoDB (`127.0.0.1:27017`) are
  published, on loopback; reach them through an SSH tunnel.
- **Because nothing is published, the address variables must be set — the code's fallbacks are
  wrong here.** `INTERNAL_API_URL`, `LOKI_HOST` (web) and `FARO_COLLECTOR_URL` default to
  `host.containers.internal` / `localhost`, which resolve to the host gateway or the container
  itself, where nothing listens any more; an unset `LOKI_HOST` in the API ships no logs at all. The values are in the `HOST_ENV_*` tables below. `--add-host` still maps
  `host.containers.internal` and `host.docker.internal` to the gateway, for anything genuinely
  running on the host.
- **Every container port is published on loopback only** (`-p 127.0.0.1:3111:3111`,
  `-p 127.0.0.1:3228:3228`, `4333` for the documentation, `4222` for Storybook), for a reverse proxy running on the host. A proxy in a container
  cannot reach them there; it has to join the `mooncellar` network instead.
- **Infrastructure is deployed only when `infra/**` or the workflow file changes.** The
  `changes` job has its own `infra` filter; the deploy `scp`s the directory to `/opt/mooncellar/infra` and runs
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`, which is idempotent: it starts what is
  missing and leaves what is already running. A push that only touches `apps/**` does not
  restart MongoDB.

### Not secrets — these live in the workflow file

A single `.github/workflows/ci.yml` deploys both apps: a `changes` job decides which
workspaces were touched, and the deploy job builds only those, ships them in one
multi-image archive over one SSH session, and restarts only the services it rebuilt.

| Value | Frontend | Backend | Documentation | Storybook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image and container name | `mooncellar-frontend` | `mooncellar-backend` | `mooncellar-docs` | `mooncellar-storybook` |
| Dockerfile | `apps/web/Dockerfile` | `apps/api/Dockerfile` | `static.Dockerfile` | `static.Dockerfile` |
| Exposed port | `3111` | `3228` | `4333` | `4222` |
| Path filter | `apps/web/**`, `packages/**`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `ci.yml` | `apps/api/**`, `packages/**`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `ci.yml` | `docs/**`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `static.Dockerfile`, `ci.yml` | `apps/web/**`, `packages/**`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `static.Dockerfile`, `ci.yml` |
| Deploy flag in the SSH script | `DEPLOY_WEB` | `DEPLOY_API` | `DEPLOY_DOCS` | `DEPLOY_STORYBOOK` |

Documentation and Storybook are static sites: `static.Dockerfile` runs the build command passed
as `BUILD`, copies the `OUT` directory into `nginx:alpine` and listens on `PORT`. They take no
`.env`.

### The reverse proxy lives in the repository

nginx runs on the host, but its site configuration is `infra/nginx/mooncellar.conf`. An infra
deploy copies it over `/etc/nginx/conf.d/mooncellar.conf` and reloads nginx; never edit the
file on the server, the next infra deploy overwrites it.

- **A new site is one `server` block plus a name in the port-80 redirect block.** Before
  swapping the file, the deploy collects every `server_name` and runs `certbot certonly --nginx
  --cert-name mooncellar.space --keep-until-expiring --renew-with-new-domains` with them: a no-op
  while the list is unchanged, a reissue of the shared certificate when a domain was added. The
  DNS record must exist before that deploy, or certbot fails and the deploy stops there.
- **Use `certbot certonly`, never `certbot --nginx` without it** — the installer writes `ssl_*`
  lines into the live file, which the next deploy discards.
- **A config that fails `nginx -t` is rolled back:** the previous file is kept as
  `/etc/nginx/mooncellar.conf.prev`, copied back, and the deploy goes red with the old
  configuration still serving.
- The deploy user must be able to run `certbot`, `nginx` and `systemctl`, which in practice means
  `root`.

## What production sets today

Verified against the running containers. The host ships far fewer keys than the tables below
list, because almost every variable the code reads has a hardcoded fallback — and in this
deployment those fallbacks happen to be the production values.

**Frontend — two keys set:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `REVALIDATE_SECRET`. The two dead keys
noted below, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOKI_HOST` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_HOST`, have since been dropped.

**Backend — fifteen keys set:** everything in its table except `FRONT_URL`, `LOCAL_CONNECTION`,
`INDEXNOW_KEY` and `STEAM_API_KEY` (added with the Steam import, not set on the host yet).

| Unset in production | Falls back to | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `INTERNAL_API_URL` | `http://host.containers.internal:3228` | **No longer correct** — set it to `http://mooncellar-backend:3228` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` | `https://mooncellar.space` | Correct; canonical links and the sitemap are fine |
| `LOKI_HOST` (web) | `http://host.containers.internal:3100` | **No longer correct** — set it to `http://loki:3100` |
| `GEO_BLOCK_COUNTRIES` | `RU` | Country blocking is on in production through this default alone |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARO_APP_NAME` | `mooncellar-frontend` | Correct |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` | `0.0.0` | Every Faro event reports 0.0.0, so telemetry cannot be filtered by release |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CORS_SERVER` | **nothing** | Read only by dead code — see below |
| `FRONT_URL` (api) | `https://mooncellar.space` | Correct |
| `INDEXNOW_KEY` | a key hardcoded in `apps/api/src/shared/constants.ts` | Works; an IndexNow key is public by design, since the host must serve it at `/<key>.txt` |

Two keys were set in production but referenced nowhere in the code — `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOKI_HOST` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_HOST`. They have been dropped from `HOST_ENV_WEB`.

> **`NEXT_PUBLIC_CORS_SERVER` is unset, and setting it would change nothing.**
> It is read only by `countVisitors` in `apps/web/src/lib/shared/utils/visitors.utils.ts`,
> which nothing imports — the request is never made. The cleanup is deleting that file, not
> adding the variable.

## `HOST_ENV_WEB` — contents

> **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the bundle at build time.** The workflow writes the
> `.env` before `docker build`, so a change here needs a rebuild and redeploy — restarting the
> container picks up nothing.
>
> **Re-running a workflow from the GitHub UI does not do it either.** A re-run reads the new
> secret, but it re-evaluates the same `changes` filters against the same commit: a run whose
> commit touched only `infra/**` skips `Build images` again and the old image keeps serving the
> old `.env`. Rotating a `HOST_ENV_*` value is what **Actions → CI/CD → Run workflow** is for —
> `workflow_dispatch` forces all three outputs to `true` and rebuilds everything.

| Variable | Secret | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | no | Public API URL used from the browser — `https://api.mooncellar.space` in production, `http://localhost:3228` in dev |
| `INTERNAL_API_URL` | no | API URL used from server components and route handlers — `http://mooncellar-backend:3228`, the container name on the `mooncellar` network. Separate from the public one, and it must be set: the fallback points at the host gateway, where nothing listens |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` | no | Public URL of the site. Canonical links, sitemap and Open Graph URLs are built from it — a wrong value here is an SEO incident, not a cosmetic bug |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CORS_SERVER` | no | Origin sent as the CORS credentials target; must match the API's `FRONT_URL` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` | no | Version tag attached to every Faro event, so telemetry can be filtered by release |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FARO_APP_NAME` | no | Application name in Grafana Faro |
| `LOKI_HOST` | no | Loki push endpoint for the `/api/logs` route handler — `http://loki:3100`. Server-side only — it must not become `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, or the endpoint ends up in the browser bundle. Must be set: the fallback is `http://host.containers.internal:3100` (`apps/web/src/app/api/logs/route.ts`), and Loki no longer publishes a port on the host |
| `GEO_BLOCK_COUNTRIES` | no | Comma-separated ISO country codes for which adult content is hidden, e.g. `RU,BY`. Unset or empty falls back to `RU`; it cannot be switched off this way. The country comes from `/app/geo/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`, downloaded by the web `Dockerfile`, and the client IP from `X-Real-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For`. Outside `next dev` an unknown country — no IP header, no match, or a missing database — counts as blocked, so a proxy that does not forward the client IP blocks every visitor |
| `REVALIDATE_SECRET` | **yes** | Shared secret for `POST /api/revalidate`, compared against the `x-revalidate-secret` header. Server-side only — never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, or the secret ships in the browser bundle. Unset disables the endpoint: it answers 503 instead of falling back to an unguarded default |

Everything the frontend needs is public by design except `REVALIDATE_SECRET`; the file also
pins the internal API address, so it stays a secret on both counts.

---

## `HOST_ENV_API` — contents

| Variable | Secret | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` | **yes** | Full MongoDB URI including credentials, database `games` — `mongodb://<MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME>:<MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD>@mongodb:27017/games?authSource=admin` against the compose MongoDB |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **yes** | Signing key for access and refresh tokens. Rotating it logs every user out |
| `JWT_EXPIRE` | no | Access token lifetime, e.g. `15m` — consumed via `ConfigService` in `auth.module.ts` |
| `FRONT_URL` | no | Public frontend URL. Drives CORS and links in generated content; must match the frontend's `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` |
| `LOCAL_CONNECTION` | no | Extra comma-separated origins allowed by CORS. Development convenience — leave empty in production |
| `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` | no | IGDB authenticates through Twitch; this is the app id |
| `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` | **yes** | Twitch app secret for the IGDB sync job |
| `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_API_KEY` | **yes** | RetroAchievements API key |
| `S3_ID` | **yes** | S3 access key id for user uploads |
| `S3_KEY` | **yes** | S3 secret access key |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | no | Spaces API endpoint, `https://sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com` (the default). The Space name goes in `S3_BUCKET`, never in this host. Replaces `S3_HOST`; `S3_HOST`, `S3_HOST_CDN` and `S3_REGION` are no longer read |
| `S3_CDN_URL` | no | CDN origin stored URLs are built from, `https://mooncellar.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com` (the default). Must stay allowed by the frontend's `images.remotePatterns` and the image proxy allowlist |
| `S3_BUCKET` | no | The single Space every upload goes to, `mooncellar` (the default). The former buckets are its top-level folders: `covers/`, `screenshots/`, `artworks/`, `characters/`, `avatars/`, `backgrounds/`, `comments/`, `common/` |
| `LOKI_HOST` | no | Loki endpoint for `pino-loki` — `http://loki:3100` |
| `FARO_COLLECTOR_URL` | no | Grafana Alloy endpoint the `faro` module forwards browser telemetry to — `http://alloy:12347/collect`. The browser never reaches Alloy itself; it posts to the API's `/faro`, which is why Alloy needs no published port. Keep the `/collect` path, it is part of the default |
| `PROMETHEUS_ENABLED` | no | `true` / `false` — switches the `/metrics` endpoint off entirely |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | **yes** | Bearer token guarding `/metrics`. Prometheus must be configured with the same value |
| `INDEXNOW_KEY` | **yes** | IndexNow key used to submit new game pages to search engines |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | no | SearXNG the admin "Fill with AI" draft searches through — `http://searxng:8080`, the `searxng` service of `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml`. The default, `http://localhost:8891`, is empty inside the container: every search step then fails |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **yes** | OpenAI key for the admin "Fill with AI" game draft. Without it `POST /games/ai-drafts` answers 503 |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | no | Model the draft runs on, `gpt-5-mini` by default |
| `SITE_SESSIONS_KEY` | **yes** | Any long random string; the cookies of the admin Sites tab are encrypted with its SHA-256. Must be the same wherever the same database is used, or stored cookies cannot be read. Without it saving a site answers 503 |
| `RECRAFT_API_TOKEN` | **yes** | Recraft API token for the admin Images tab (recraft.ai → Profile → API). Without it generating with a Recraft model answers 503; OpenAI models keep working through `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY` | **yes** | SteamGridDB API key (steamgriddb.com → Preferences → API) the draft takes covers and hero banners from. Without it that step fails and the draft falls back to images found elsewhere |
| `STEAM_API_KEY` | **yes** | Steam Web API key (steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) the Steam library import reads owned games with. Without it linking Steam answers 503 |
| `IGDB_AUTO_LINK` | no | `true` lets the nightly IGDB sync link a new IGDB game to a parser-created game it matches with confidence. Unset or anything else sends every match to the admin Conflicts tab instead. A game added by hand always goes to Conflicts, whatever the value |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | no | Web push public key. Generate the pair once with `bunx web-push generate-vapid-keys`. Every instance on the same database (production and a local `dev:api`) must use the same pair: a browser subscribes to one public key, and a push signed with another pair is refused. Replacing the pair silently invalidates every existing subscription. Without it the push toggle is hidden and nothing is sent |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | **yes** | Web push private key of the same pair |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | no | Contact the push services see, `mailto:admin@mooncellar.space` by default |
| `DISABLE_CRONS` | no | `true` stops every `@Cron` job. Local development only, because the local `.env` points at the production database and Space. Never set it in `HOST_ENV_API` |

---

## Not part of deployment

These exist locally but must never end up in `HOST_ENV_*`:

| Variable | Where it belongs |
|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | The `game-adder` MCP server — a local development tool. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is a real account password; keep it out of any shared secret |
| `CHROME_PATH`, `CHECK_BASE_URL` | `bun --filter web check:layout`, run on a developer machine |
| `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`, `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | `infra/docker-compose.yml`, local MongoDB only |
| `LEGACY_S3_ID`, `LEGACY_S3_KEY`, `LEGACY_S3_ENDPOINT` | The one-off `apps/api/scripts/transfer-s3.ts` run that copies the regru buckets into the Space. Drop them once the old buckets are deleted |

## Dead variables — drop them during the migration

Present in the current `.env` files, referenced nowhere in the code:

| Variable | Why it is dead |
|---|---|
| `GEOIP_DB_PATH` | The database path is hardcoded as `/app/geo/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` in `geo.utils.ts`, matching the `ADD` in the Dockerfile |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_HOST` | No reference in `apps/web/src` — image hosts come from `next.config.mjs` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOKI_HOST` | No reference either; the route handler uses the server-side `LOKI_HOST` |
| `MOONCELLAR_CLIENT_PATH` | Only used by `check-schema-parity.ts`, which is deleted together with the duplicated schemas |

---

## Checklist before the first monorepo deploy

1. `HOST_ENV_WEB`, `HOST_ENV_API` and `HOST_ENV_INFRA` created. The old `HOST_ENV`, `WORK_DIR` and
   `DEPLOY_ROOT` are deleted only after the first successful deploy — until the merge lands
   they still serve the workflow on `main`.
2. The workflow references the new names — grep the yml for `HOST_ENV` without a suffix and for
   `WORK_DIR`, and expect no hits.
3. `git check-ignore -v apps/web/.env apps/api/.env infra/.env` reports a match for all three. The merged root
   `.gitignore` must keep the pattern as `.env`, not `/.env`: with a leading slash it only
   matches the repository root, and `apps/api/.env` — `JWT_SECRET`, `S3_KEY`,
   `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` — becomes committable.
4. `FRONT_URL` (api) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` (web) point at the same origin, as do
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CORS_SERVER` and the API's CORS configuration.
5. The first run after the migration touches root files, so the `changes` job marks both
   apps as changed and both are rebuilt and restarted in one pass. Watch that run: a failure
   in either image build stops the deploy before anything is copied, so the host keeps
   running the previous versions of both.

## Moving to a new host

The deploy creates its own containers and network, so the host needs almost nothing prepared.
What it does need, and what the pipeline will not do for you:

1. **Docker with Compose v2, enabled at boot.** `systemctl enable --now docker`, and
   `docker compose version` must answer — `docker-compose.prod.yml` is a Compose Spec file
   (top-level `name:`, `${VAR:?}`, `external: true`) that the old Python `docker-compose` v1
   cannot parse. The `Check the server` step asserts both before anything is built.
   `--restart always` is executed by the daemon, so a daemon that does not start brings nothing
   up with it. `SSH_USER` must reach it: `root`, or a user in the `docker` group.
2. **The MongoDB data.** Nothing in the pipeline copies a database. MongoDB bind-mounts
   `MONGO_DATA_DIR`, so moving hosts is moving that directory — put it in place *before* the
   first deploy, or compose starts an empty one and initialises a new root user.

   Copy it from a **stopped** MongoDB: a `dbpath` snapshotted while mongod was writing can
   refuse to start. An empty `mongod.lock` is the sign of a clean shutdown — two bytes in it
   means the copy was taken from a running server, and it is worth repeating.

   The files are also WiredTiger internals, readable only by the same major version. The old
   host ran `mongo:latest` and its `WiredTiger` file reads `WiredTiger 12.0.0`, which is
   MongoDB 8 — hence `image: mongo:8` in `docker-compose.prod.yml`. Confirm with
   `podman exec Mongo mongod --version` before trusting a file copy; pointing `mongo:7` at
   these files fails at startup rather than silently.

   ```bash
   # old host, mongod stopped
   tar -C <old dbpath> -czf mongo-data.tgz .

   # new host
   mkdir -p <MONGO_DATA_DIR> && tar -C <MONGO_DATA_DIR> -xzf mongo-data.tgz
   ```

   Ownership sorts itself out: the `mongo` image's entrypoint starts as root and `chown`s
   `/data/db` to its own `mongodb` user before dropping privileges.

   Across major versions, or from a running instance, use a dump instead:

   ```bash
   # old host
   podman exec mongodb mongodump --archive --gzip -u <user> -p <pass> \
     --authenticationDatabase admin > mooncellar.archive.gz

   # new host, after the first infra deploy created the mongodb container
   docker exec -i mongodb mongorestore --archive --gzip -u <user> -p <pass> \
     --authenticationDatabase admin < mooncellar.archive.gz
   ```

   A carried-over directory keeps its own users. Changing `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` afterwards does
   nothing — the credentials live in the data files, and only `db.changeUserPassword` in a shell
   changes them.
3. **The reverse proxy and TLS.** Ports `3111` and `3228` are published on `127.0.0.1`; nothing
   else terminates HTTPS or routes `mooncellar.space` / `api.mooncellar.space` to them. The
   proxy must pass the client address in `X-Real-IP` or `X-Forwarded-For`: without it the web
   app cannot resolve a country and treats every visitor as geo-blocked.
4. **A firewall that understands Docker.** `ufw` filters the `INPUT` chain, while Docker's
   published ports traverse `FORWARD` through `DOCKER-USER`. Everything is published on loopback
   only, so nothing is exposed until the proxy is — keep it that way when adding a port.
5. **DNS last.** Deploy, check the new host through a hosts entry, and only then move the A
   records. The old host keeps serving until they propagate.
