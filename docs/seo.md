# SEO

An inventory of the search-related functionality in `apps/web`: what exists and where it lives.

## Metadata

`src/app/layout.tsx` declares the defaults every route inherits:

- `metadataBase` from `FRONT_URL`, so relative canonicals and image paths resolve to absolute URLs.
- `title.default` — `MoonCellar — Game Tracker & Database`; `title.template` — `%s | MoonCellar`.
- A site description and a `keywords` list.
- Open Graph defaults: `siteName: "MoonCellar"`, `type: "website"`, `locale: "en_US"`, and
  `/images/og-default.png` (1200×630, PNG) as the fallback image.
- `twitter.card: "summary_large_image"`.

Each route adds its own metadata on top:

| Route                            | Title                                       | Canonical                        | Other                                                                                                                                                           |

| `/lists`                         | `Lists`                                     | `/lists`                         | own `keywords`                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/requests`                      | `Requests`                                  | —                                | `robots: { index: false, follow: true }`                                                                                                                        |

A page-level `openGraph` object replaces the parent's rather than merging with it, which is why
the game and hub routes repeat `siteName`, `type` and `locale`.

When `generateMetadata` cannot find the entity (game, hub, user, list) it returns
`title: "Page not found"` with `robots: { index: false, follow: false }`. When the lookup fails
for any other reason (an API outage, a 5xx) it returns neutral metadata without `robots` —
`Game`, `Games`, `Profile`, `List`, or `{}` on a profile tab — and the page component's own
throw renders `src/app/error.tsx` (`ErrorPage`), which is never cached.

## Status codes

`fetchOrNull` (`src/lib/shared/utils/not-found.utils.ts`) turns a 404 from the API into `null`
and rethrows anything else, a 400 included. Routes with a dynamic segment wrap their lookup in
`React.cache`, call it from both `generateMetadata` and the page component, and call
`notFound()` only from the page component — so a missing entity answers with a real 404 rather
than a 200 carrying the not-found page.

The hubs resolve their slug against the full genre or platform list, which is not a
`fetchOrNull` lookup: the list request throws on failure, and the slug is a 404 only when the
list loaded and does not contain it. The three game blocks below the lookup fall back to an
empty list on error, so one failing query does not take the hub down.

Two routes answer with a permanent redirect (308) instead of a duplicate page: the legacy
`/user/<name>?list=<tab>` goes to `/user/<name>/<tab>` with the rest of the query kept, and a
list opened by an outdated slug goes to its current `/user/<name>/lists/<slug>`.

No route segment has its own `error.tsx`: every error reaches `src/app/error.tsx`, which renders
`ErrorPage`, never `NotFoundPage`.

The root layout has no `Suspense` boundary; routes that need one (`/games`, `/lists`,
`/requests`, and `/user/[name]` in its profile layout) declare it inside the route, and
`GauntletPage` declares its own.

## Rendering

Everything a crawler needs is in the server response.

- `/games` is an async server component. It rebuilds the query string from `searchParams`,
  parses it with the same `parseQueryFilters` the client uses, fetches page 1 (`take: 60`) and
  passes it to the client page as `initialData`. `GamesPage` compares the two React Query keys
  with TanStack's `hashKey`, so the client reuses the server payload instead of refetching.
- The catalogue grid is CSS (`repeat(auto-fill, …)` in `GamesCards.module.scss`), so all 60 game
  links exist in the HTML without any DOM measurement. `react-virtualized` is used only by the
  dropdown list component.
- The game page, both hubs and the homepage fetch their data in the server component and render
  it directly.

`<h1>` per page: the homepage banner title, `Games` on the catalogue, `Lists`, `Gauntlet`, the
game name on a game page, the hub title on both hubs, the user name on a profile, the list name
on a list page, the Requests heading, and the 404 and error pages. The catalogue, `Lists`, the
list page and the Gauntlet render theirs through `SectionTitle as="h1"`.

Visible breadcrumbs (`src/lib/shared/ui/Breadcrumbs`) appear on the game page, the catalogue,
both hubs, the Gauntlet, `Lists`, list pages, `Requests` and user profiles.

## Structured data

`src/lib/shared/ui/JsonLd` renders a `<script type="application/ld+json">` with `<` escaped;
the builders live in `src/lib/shared/utils/json-ld.utils.ts`.

| Type                       | Where                                              | Contents                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WebSite` + `SearchAction` | root layout, every page                            | search endpoint `/games?search={search_term_string}`                           |
| `VideoGame`                | game page                                          | name, url, description, cover, genres, `datePublished` from `first_release`    |
| `AggregateRating`          | inside `VideoGame`                                 | only when the game has at least 10 MoonCellar ratings; scale 1–10              |
| `Review`                   | inside `VideoGame`                                 | the loaded reviews that have a rating, an author and text and are not spoilers |
| `BreadcrumbList`           | game page, catalogue, both hubs, Gauntlet, `Lists` | the same trail as the visible breadcrumbs                                      |
| `ItemList`                 | catalogue, both hubs                               | the games rendered on the page, with position, url and name                    |

## Hub pages

`/games/genre/[slug]` and `/games/platform/[slug]` render from one component
(`src/lib/pages/HubPage`) and read only `gamesApi.getAll`.

| Block           | Query                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most popular    | `sortBy: "rating"`, `sortOrder: "desc"`, `types: ["Main Game"]`, `votes`, `take: 5`                             |
| Recent releases | `sortBy: "first_release"`, `sortOrder: "desc"`, `types: ["Main Game"]`, `years: [null, currentYear]`, `take: 6` |
| All games       | `take: 30`, page 1                                                                                              |

The vote threshold is 100 for genres with 5 000 games or more and 20 otherwise; the platform hub
always uses 20. `types: ["Main Game"]` keeps DLC and re-releases out of the ranked blocks, and
`years: [null, currentYear]` keeps unreleased titles out of the recent one.

Each hub ends with a link into the catalogue with the filter applied
(`/games?selectedGenres[]=…`, `/games?selectedPlatforms[]=…`) and a block of sibling links —
every genre with at least 100 games, or the first 24 platforms. Hubs have no pagination and read
no `searchParams`, which is what lets them be cached.

The platform hub's "recent releases" hint states that dates are a game's first release anywhere,
not its release on that platform.

## Caching

| Route                                | Strategy                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/games/[slug]`, both hubs           | ISR: `export const revalidate = 3600` together with `generateStaticParams()` returning `[]` — nothing is prerendered at build time, and the route is cached on demand |
| `/`                                  | `force-dynamic`; featured platforms come from `unstable_cache` with a 3600 s revalidate                                                                               |
| `/games`                             | dynamic, it reads `searchParams`                                                                                                                                      |
| `/lists`                             | dynamic, it reads `searchParams` and passes page 1 to the client as `initialData`                                                                                     |
| `/user/[name]`, `/user/[name]/[tab]` | dynamic: the profile layout reads `cookies()` to decide who is viewing                                                                                                |
| `/user/[name]/lists/[slug]`          | dynamic: it reads `cookies()` (forwarded to `by-slug` for private lists) and `searchParams` (`page`, sort)                                                            |
| `/requests`, `/gauntlet`             | static: no server fetch, no `revalidate`; the client page reads the query string inside its `Suspense`                                                                |
| `sitemap.xml`                        | `force-dynamic`, with each upstream call wrapped in `unstable_cache` at 3600 s                                                                                        |
| `/img/image-proxy`                   | `force-dynamic`; the upstream fetch revalidates hourly and the response carries `public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=86400`                                                |

A route that reads `searchParams` cannot be statically cached, which is why the two hubs take no
query parameters.

A cached game page is purged on demand by `revalidateGamePage`
(`src/lib/entities/game/api/game.actions.ts`), called after admin edits and by
`POST /api/revalidate` (header `x-revalidate-secret` matching `REVALIDATE_SECRET`, body
`{ slugs: string[] }`, up to 200).

## robots.txt and sitemap

`src/app/robots.ts` allows everything for `*`, disallows `/admin` and `/api`, and points at
`${FRONT_URL}/sitemap.xml`.

`src/app/sitemap.ts` emits, in order:

1. The three static links from the `links` constant — `/`, `/games`, `/gauntlet`.
2. Every game: `/games/<slug>` with `lastModified` from the record and, when the game has a
   cover, an `<image:loc>` pointing at `/img/image-proxy`.
3. Genre hubs with at least 100 games (`MIN_GAMES_FOR_HUB`), slugged with `toSlug`.
4. Every platform hub.
5. Every user profile, with `lastModified`.

Each of the four upstream calls has its own `unstable_cache` entry and falls back to an empty
list on error, so one failing endpoint does not empty the whole sitemap.

## Images

- `/img/image-proxy` (`src/app/img/image-proxy/route.ts`) streams remote covers. It requires
  `https`, matches the hostname against an allowlist (IGDB, the S3 and DigitalOcean Spaces
  buckets), verifies that the upstream content type starts with `image/`, and answers 400, 403
  or 502 otherwise. It sits outside `/api` so that `robots.txt` does not block the images the
  sitemap and Open Graph tags reference.
- `next.config.mjs` lists the same hosts in `images.remotePatterns` for `next/image`, plus
  RetroAchievements, YouTube thumbnails, VNDB, Alphacoders, the API host and `localhost`.
- `/_next/static/media/*` is served with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
- Game covers use ``alt={`${game.name} cover`}``; decorative images carry an empty `alt`.

## Headers

`next.config.mjs` sends `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
on every path.

## Search engine verification

- `public/yandex_058d2e4bbfa6f684.html` — Yandex Webmaster.
- `public/74a6b85cd7164d77a0cccb5baae3d563.txt` — a key file in the IndexNow format, its body
  repeating its own name.

`meta keywords` are declared on the root layout, the homepage, the catalogue, `Lists`, the
Gauntlet, game pages and user profiles.
