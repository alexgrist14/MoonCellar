# MoonCellar

## Package manager

This project uses **bun** exclusively. Using `npm` is forbidden.

- Install dependencies with `bun install` (never `npm install`).
- Add/remove packages with `bun add` / `bun remove`.
- Run scripts with `bun run <script>` (or `bunx` for one-off binaries).
- Do not create or commit `package-lock.json` — only `bun.lock`/`bun.lockb` is allowed.

## Code generation

- Do not add comments when generating or modifying code.

## Styling

- Only use the global CSS variables defined in `:root` (see `src/lib/app/styles/vars/`) for colors, borders, padding, radius, gap, etc. — never hardcode raw values (hex colors, px, etc.) for anything already covered by a `:root` variable.
- If a new value is needed that isn't covered by an existing `:root` variable, add it as a new CSS variable in `:root` (in the relevant file under `src/lib/app/styles/vars/`) instead of hardcoding it inline.

## Language

- This CLAUDE.md file must be written in English only.
