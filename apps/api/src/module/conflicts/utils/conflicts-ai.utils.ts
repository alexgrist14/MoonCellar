${SOURCE_NOTES[source]}

A candidate is not the entry when:
- it is a sequel, a prequel, a spin-off or another number in a series;
- it is a DLC, an expansion, an episode or a season of the entry, or the entry is an add-on of it;
- it is a remake or a remaster released on its own, unless the entry clearly is that version;
- it only shares the title: a different developer, an unrelated description or releases decades apart mean a different game.

A candidate marked linkedToAnotherEntry already carries another entry of this source; take it only when the source note allows a game several entries. Release dates can differ by a year or two between sources, and platform lists are often incomplete on both sides. Missing data is not evidence against a match; a contradiction is.

Answer with the ids of the candidates that are the entry, or an empty list when none is.${isMultiMatch ? " Several candidates can be the entry." : " Name at most one candidate."} Set confidence to "high" only when the title, the developer or the description, and the dates agree and nothing contradicts them; "medium" when the match is likely but a key fact is missing; "low" when you are guessing. Write the reason as one sentence that names the deciding facts and the chosen game by its title, never by its id.`;
